HOW TO INSTALL ARCHLINUX ON A OLPC XO 1.5 LAPTOP

some first considerations before starting:

    - the XO 1.5 cannot boot the install media directly, so it needs to be install on a different machine.
    - it needs the last version of the Firmware for the XO 1.5.
    - it needs to unlock the XO with the devs key.

	KERNEL COMPILE

    I compiled the kernel from an ArchLinux host, so I've used the PKGBUILD file from the Arch repo and added some files including the kernel config file.
    If you have an 32bit host the compile should be as usual, I haven't.

    Compile on an 64bit host using:

        $ linux32 makepkg --config makepkg.pentium4.conf 
    
    At this step the config menu will appear and you can make modifications or just Exit and the build will continue.
         

	INSTALL LINUX

    The installation is common as any Linux Install. The olpc boots from an USB or SD media.
    I use a 4GB SD card and install inside a Virtual machine. Any method is of installing Linux is valid.
    
    The original XO uses 2 partition:
        - boot ext2 (70M)
        - root ext3 (1.4GB)
    OpenFirmware boots from ext2, ext3 or Fat32 Partitions, 
    
    This is not estrictly necesary (creating 2 separated partitions), if you choose to do that then the contents on the boot partition are different. I'll explain latter how.

    *FOR VIRTUALBOX
    Mount the SD directly as an virtualDisk (this is what I did). To mount the SD  as an VirtualDisk I use:

        $ sudo VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename xo.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/mmcblk0

    Because I use the sudo command the file it create it's own by the root user so VirtualBox should also be run as root, on my case I'm saving the file as xo.vmdk, and my SD is located on /dev/mmcblk0.

    Open Virtualbox create a new 32bit Linux Machine (I use Arch Linux). Then on the Hard Disk step chose "Use an existing virtual hard disk file" and search for your file. Create the Machine.

    Download the ISO to install Linux add it to your Virtual Machine and boot it.

    From this point do a typical Linux installation, make sure you use a DOS type partition (not EFI) when installing.

    Reboot

    *In case you haven't created a new user:
      
        # useradd --system -m -d /home/olpc -s /bin/bash -U olpc

    Edit the file /etc/mkinitcpio.conf and uncomment:

        COMPRESSION="gzip"

    Copy the compile Kernel Package from before and install using:

        $ sudo pacman -U linux-via-olpc[...].tar.zst

    only the kernel and headers are needed.


	XO INSTRUCTIONS

    First change the root partition label:

        $ sudo tune2fs /dev/sdXY -L ARCHroot

    Remember to change sdXY with the respective root volume.

    The next step is to copy the files inside /, the folders should contain:

        /boot
        /boot/olpc.fth
        /boot/vmzlinux-via-olpc
        /boot/initramfs-via-olpc.img
        /security
        /security/dev.key

    This is mandatory inside the first partition must have that structure. If you create a separate partition for boot the files must be inside /boot as:

	/boot/boot
	/boot/boot/olpc.fth
         .
         .
        /boot/security
         .


    you can copy the kernel and initram files inside the /boot/boot without problem just after you install the tar.zst files.


    At this point you can poweroff and move the SD to the XO. Insert the SD and power on the OLPC.
    Alternative you can hold the check gamepad button (the one on the right) before starting on and see the boot process.

    To complete the installation install a Desktop Environment (XFCE):

        $ sudo pacman -S xfce4 xfce4-goodies xorg-server xorg-xinit

    Install the framebuffer driver and start with:

        $ sudo pacman -S xf86-video-fbdev

    Set .xinitrc on ~/ directory:

        exec xfce4-session

    Reboot and start DE with: 

        $ startx
