HOW TO INSTALL ARCHLINUX ON A OLPC XO 1.5 LAPTOP

some first considerations before starting:

    - the XO 1.5 cannot boot the install media directly, so it needs to be install on a Virtual Machine.
    - it needs the last version of the Firmware for the XO 1.5.
    - it needs to unlock the XO with the devs key.

	KERNEL COMPILE

    I compiled the kernel from an ArchLinux host, so I've used the PKGBUILD file from the Arch repo and added some files including the kernel config file.
    If you have an 32bit host the compile should be as usual, I haven't.

    Compile an 32bit kernel on an 64bit host using:

        $ linux32 makepkg --config .makepkg.pentium4.conf 

	INSTALL LINUX

    To create the image we need an SD where to install Linux. I use a 4GB SD
    I use Virtual box
    
    The original XO uses 2 partition:
        - boot ext2 (70M)
        - root ext3 (1.4GB)
    OpenFirmware boots from ext2, ext3 or Fat32 Partitions, 
    This is not estrictly necesary, creating 2 separated partitions, if you choose to do that then the contents on the boot partition are different.

    VIRTUALBOX
    On VirtualBox mount the SD directly as an virtualDisk (this is what I did), anothe approch is to install linux on a new Machine inside Vitualbox and later move or clone the install on the SD
    to mount SD  as an VirtualDisk

        sudo VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename xo.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/mmcblk0

    Because I use the sudo command the file it create it's own by the root user so VirtualBox should also be run as root, on my case I'm saving the file as xo.vmdk, and my SD is located on /dev/mmcblk0.

    Open Virtualbox create a new 32bit Linux Machine (I use Arch Linux). Then on the Hard Disk step chose "Use an existing virtual hard disk file" and search for your file. Create the Machine.
    Download the ISO to install Linux add it to your Virtual Machine and boot it.
    
    DIRECT INSTALL
    You can also install directly on the SD card as similar as installing on a HDD disk.

    From this point do a typical Linux installation, make sure you use a DOS type partition (not EFI) when installing.

    Reboot

    Create a new User:
      
        useradd --system -d /home/olpc -s /bin/bash -U olpc

    !!!! IMPORTANT
    Before Installing the Kernel there is a recent problem during the installation (this was not before). What you need is to downgrade the kmod package to 29-1, first download and install:

        wget https://archive.archlinux32.org/packages/k/kmod/kmod-29-1.0-pentium4.pkg.tar.zst

        sudo pacman -U kmod-29-1.0-pentium4.pkg.tar.zst

    Edit the file /etc/mkinitcpio.conf and uncomment:

        COMPRESSION="gzip"

    Copy the compile Kernel Package from before and install using:

        sudo pacman -U linux-via-olpc[...].tar.zst

    only the kernel and headers are needed.


	XO INSTRUCTIONS

    The next step is to copy the files inside /, the folders should look:

        /boot
        /boot/olpc.fth
        /boot/vmzlinux-via-olpc
        /boot/initramfs-via-olpc.img
        /security
        /security/dev.key

    This is mandatory inside the first partition must have that structure. If you create a separate partition for boot the files must be inside /boot as:

	/boot/boot
	/boot/boot/olpc.fth
         .
         .
        /boot/security
         .

    you can copy the kernel and initram files inside the /boot/boot without problem just after you install the tar.zst files.

    At this point you can poweroff and move the SD to the XO. Insert the SD and power on the OLPC.
    Alternative you can hold the check gamepad button before starting on and see atch the boot process.
